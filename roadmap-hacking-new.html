                    <div class="roadmap-number">01</div>
                    <h2>The Absolute Fundamentals — Understanding Computers</h2>
                    
                    <h3>🏠 What IS a Computer Anyway?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Think of a computer like a small town with different buildings and workers.</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>The CPU (Brain/Mayor):</strong> The Central Processing Unit is like the mayor who makes all decisions and coordinates everything. When you click something, the CPU decides what to do next. It's FAST — billions of decisions per second!</li>
                        <li><strong>RAM (Short-term Memory/Desk):</strong> Random Access Memory is like your work desk — it holds things you're actively using RIGHT NOW. Close a program? That stuff gets cleared off the desk. Turn off the computer? The desk is wiped clean.</li>
                        <li><strong>Storage/Hard Drive (Long-term Memory/Filing Cabinet):</strong> This is where files STAY even when the computer is off — like a filing cabinet. Your photos, documents, programs all live here permanently (until you delete them).</li>
                        <li><strong>The Operating System (Town Manager/Government):</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux — these are the "governments" that manage the town. They decide which programs can run, who gets access to what files, and keep everything organized.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> When you open a photo:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You double-click the file (stored in the filing cabinet/hard drive)</li>
                        <li>The OS (town manager) sees your request and tells the CPU (mayor)</li>
                        <li>The CPU loads the photo into RAM (puts it on your desk)</li>
                        <li>Your monitor displays it (you can see what's on your desk)</li>
                        <li>Close the photo? It's removed from RAM but stays in storage</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>📁 Files & Folders — The Digital Filing System</h3>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Files are like individual documents. Folders are like manila folders or binders that hold related documents together.</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>File Names:</strong> Like labels on documents. <code>report.pdf</code> tells you it's a report in PDF format. The part after the dot (`.pdf`) is called the file extension — it tells the computer what TYPE of file it is.</li>
                        <li><strong>File Paths:</strong> The address to reach a file. Like a street address: <code>C:\Users\YourName\Documents\report.pdf</code> means "Start at the C drive, go into Users folder, then YourName folder, then Documents folder, and there's the report."</li>
                        <li><strong>Hidden Files:</strong> Some files are invisible by default (like secret passages). They start with a dot in Linux (`.secret`) or have a hidden attribute in Windows. The OS hides them so beginners don't accidentally delete important stuff.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Security Connection:</strong> Hackers look for sensitive files left in obvious places — passwords in text files, backup files with `.bak` extension, configuration files with default passwords. Knowing how files work helps you find (and protect) secrets.</p>

                    <h3>🔐 Permissions — Who Can Do What?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Permissions are like keys to different rooms. Some people can only LOOK in a room (read), some can CHANGE things (write), some can RUN programs (execute).</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>Read (R):</strong> You can open and view the file, but not change it. Like reading a book from the library.</li>
                        <li><strong>Write (W):</strong> You can modify the file — add, delete, or change content. Like writing in your own notebook.</li>
                        <li><strong>Execute (X):</strong> You can RUN the file as a program. Like pressing "play" on a video or running an app.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Example in Linux:</strong> <code>-rwxr-xr--</code> looks scary, but here's what it means:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First character: <code>-</code> means it's a file (d would mean directory/folder)</li>
                        <li>Next 3 characters <code>rwx</code>: The OWNER can read, write, and execute</li>
                        <li>Next 3 characters <code>r-x</code>: The GROUP can read and execute, but NOT write</li>
                        <li>Last 3 characters <code>r--</code>: OTHERS (everyone else) can only read</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Why This Matters for Hacking:</strong> Weak permissions are a TOP security issue! If a sensitive file has <code>-rwxrwxrwx</code> (read/write/execute for EVERYONE), any user can steal or modify it. Hackers look for these mistakes!</p>

                    <h3>⚙️ Processes — Programs in Action</h3>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> A process is like a worker actively doing a job. The program file is the job description, the process is the person actually working.</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>Starting a Process:</strong> When you double-click an app, the OS creates a process — loads the program into RAM and starts executing instructions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Process ID (PID):</strong> Every process gets a unique number (like an employee ID). The OS uses this to track and manage it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Killing a Process:</strong> If a program freezes, you can "kill" its process (fire the worker). In Windows: Task Manager. In Linux: <code>kill &lt;PID&gt;</code></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Security Connection:</strong> Hackers can inject malicious code into running processes, hide malware as fake system processes, or exploit vulnerable processes to gain control. Understanding processes helps you spot what's NORMAL vs SUSPICIOUS.</p>

                    <h3>🌐 Networking Basics — Computers Talking to Each Other</h3>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> The internet is like a massive postal system. Computers send "letters" (data packets) to each other using addresses.</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Like a house address. `192.168.1.1` is a typical home network address. `8.8.8.8` is Google's public DNS server. Every device on the internet has one.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ports:</strong> Like apartment numbers. One IP address (building) can host many services (apartments). Port 80 = web traffic (HTTP), Port 443 = secure web (HTTPS), Port 22 = SSH (remote login).</li>
                        <li><strong>Packets:</strong> Data is broken into small chunks called packets (like breaking a long letter into pages). Each packet has a "from" address, "to" address, and the actual data inside.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Real Example:</strong> When you visit <code>google.com</code>:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Your computer asks a DNS server "What's the IP address for google.com?" (like looking up a phone number)</li>
                        <li>DNS replies: "It's 142.250.80.46"</li>
                        <li>Your computer sends a packet to 142.250.80.46 on Port 443 saying "Hey, send me your homepage!"</li>
                        <li>Google's server sends back packets with the HTML, CSS, images</li>
                        <li>Your browser assembles the packets and displays the page</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Hackers intercept packets (sniffing), pretend to be other computers (spoofing), or flood servers with fake packets (DDoS attacks). Knowing how networking works is ESSENTIAL.</p>

                    <h3>📝 What is "Code" / Programming?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Code is like a recipe. You write step-by-step instructions, and the computer follows them EXACTLY (even if your instructions are wrong!).</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>Variables:</strong> Named storage boxes. <code>age = 25</code> means "create a box called 'age' and put 25 inside."</li>
                        <li><strong>If Statements:</strong> Decisions. "If it's raining, bring umbrella. Otherwise, don't." Computers make millions of these tiny decisions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Loops:</strong> Repetition. "Do this 100 times" or "Keep doing this until X happens."</li>
                        <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Reusable recipes. Instead of writing "make a sandwich" steps every time, define it once and call "makeSandwich()" whenever you need it.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Simple Example in Python:</strong></p>
                    <pre><code>age = 16
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote!")
else:
    print("Too young to vote.")</code></pre>
                    <p>This checks if age is 18 or more. If yes, print one message. If no, print another.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why Hackers Need Code:</strong> Automation! Instead of manually checking 1000 servers, write a script to do it in seconds. Parsing logs, crafting exploits, building tools — all require coding.</p>

                    <h3>💻 The Command Line / Terminal — The Power User Interface</h3>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> The command line is like texting directly with the computer. Instead of clicking icons (pointing at things), you TYPE exactly what you want.</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>Why Use It?:</strong> Faster, more powerful, scriptable. Many hacking tools ONLY have command-line interfaces.</li>
                        <li><strong>Basic Commands (Linux/Mac):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>pwd</code> = Print Working Directory (where am I?)</li>
                                <li><code>ls</code> = List files in current folder</li>
                                <li><code>cd &lt;folder&gt;</code> = Change Directory (move into a folder)</li>
                                <li><code>cat &lt;file&gt;</code> = Show file contents</li>
                                <li><code>mkdir &lt;name&gt;</code> = Make a new directory</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Real Example:</strong> You want to see what's in your Documents folder:</p>
                    <pre><code>cd ~/Documents    # Move into Documents folder
ls                # List all files there
cat report.txt    # Read report.txt</code></pre>

                    <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Ethical hackers spend 80% of their time in terminals. You'll use command-line tools like <code>nmap</code>, <code>metasploit</code>, <code>burpsuite</code>, etc. Get comfortable NOW.</p>
