                <!-- CHAPTER 01: FUNDAMENTALS I -->
                <div class="roadmap-section">
                    <div class="roadmap-number">01</div>
                    <h2>The Absolute Fundamentals — Understanding Computers</h2>
                    
                    <h3>🏠 What IS a Computer Anyway?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Think of a computer like a small town with different buildings and workers.</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>The CPU (Brain/Mayor):</strong> The Central Processing Unit is like the mayor who makes all decisions and coordinates everything. When you click something, the CPU decides what to do next. It's FAST — billions of decisions per second!</li>
                        <li><strong>RAM (Short-term Memory/Desk):</strong> Random Access Memory is like your work desk — it holds things you're actively using RIGHT NOW. Close a program? That stuff gets cleared off the desk. Turn off the computer? The desk is wiped clean.</li>
                        <li><strong>Storage/Hard Drive (Long-term Memory/Filing Cabinet):</strong> This is where files STAY even when the computer is off — like a filing cabinet. Your photos, documents, programs all live here permanently (until you delete them).</li>
                        <li><strong>The Operating System (Town Manager/Government):</strong> Windows, macOS, Linux — these are the "governments" that manage the town. They decide which programs can run, who gets access to what files, and keep everything organized.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Real-World Example:</strong> When you open a photo:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You double-click the file (stored in the filing cabinet/hard drive)</li>
                        <li>The OS (town manager) sees your request and tells the CPU (mayor)</li>
                        <li>The CPU loads the photo into RAM (puts it on your desk)</li>
                        <li>Your monitor displays it (you can see what's on your desk)</li>
                        <li>Close the photo? It's removed from RAM but stays in storage</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>📁 Files & Folders — The Digital Filing System</h3>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Files are like individual documents. Folders are like manila folders or binders that hold related documents together.</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>File Names:</strong> Like labels on documents. <code>report.pdf</code> tells you it's a report in PDF format. The part after the dot (`.pdf`) is called the file extension — it tells the computer what TYPE of file it is.</li>
                        <li><strong>File Paths:</strong> The address to reach a file. Like a street address: <code>C:\Users\YourName\Documents\report.pdf</code> means "Start at the C drive, go into Users folder, then YourName folder, then Documents folder, and there's the report."</li>
                        <li><strong>Hidden Files:</strong> Some files are invisible by default (like secret passages). They start with a dot in Linux (`.secret`) or have a hidden attribute in Windows. The OS hides them so beginners don't accidentally delete important stuff.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Security Connection:</strong> Hackers look for sensitive files left in obvious places — passwords in text files, backup files with `.bak` extension, configuration files with default passwords. Knowing how files work helps you find (and protect) secrets.</p>

                    <h3>🔐 Permissions — Who Can Do What?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Permissions are like keys to different rooms. Some people can only LOOK in a room (read), some can CHANGE things (write), some can RUN programs (execute).</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>Read (R):</strong> You can open and view the file, but not change it. Like reading a book from the library.</li>
                        <li><strong>Write (W):</strong> You can modify the file — add, delete, or change content. Like writing in your own notebook.</li>
                        <li><strong>Execute (X):</strong> You can RUN the file as a program. Like pressing "play" on a video or running an app.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Example in Linux:</strong> <code>-rwxr-xr--</code> looks scary, but here's what it means:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First character: <code>-</code> means it's a file (d would mean directory/folder)</li>
                        <li>Next 3 characters <code>rwx</code>: The OWNER can read, write, and execute</li>
                        <li>Next 3 characters <code>r-x</code>: The GROUP can read and execute, but NOT write</li>
                        <li>Last 3 characters <code>r--</code>: OTHERS (everyone else) can only read</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Why This Matters for Hacking:</strong> Weak permissions are a TOP security issue! If a sensitive file has <code>-rwxrwxrwx</code> (read/write/execute for EVERYONE), any user can steal or modify it. Hackers look for these mistakes!</p>

                    <h3>⚙️ Processes — Programs in Action</h3>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> A process is like a worker actively doing a job. The program file is the job description, the process is the person actually working.</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>Starting a Process:</strong> When you double-click an app, the OS creates a process — loads the program into RAM and starts executing instructions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Process ID (PID):</strong> Every process gets a unique number (like an employee ID). The OS uses this to track and manage it.</li>
                        <li><strong>Killing a Process:</strong> If a program freezes, you can "kill" its process (fire the worker). In Windows: Task Manager. In Linux: <code>kill &lt;PID&gt;</code></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Security Connection:</strong> Hackers can inject malicious code into running processes, hide malware as fake system processes, or exploit vulnerable processes to gain control. Understanding processes helps you spot what's NORMAL vs SUSPICIOUS.</p>

                    <h3>🌐 Networking Basics — Computers Talking to Each Other</h3>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> The internet is like a massive postal system. Computers send "letters" (data packets) to each other using addresses.</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>IP Address:</strong> Like a house address. `192.168.1.1` is a typical home network address. `8.8.8.8` is Google's public DNS server. Every device on the internet has one.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ports:</strong> Like apartment numbers. One IP address (building) can host many services (apartments). Port 80 = web traffic (HTTP), Port 443 = secure web (HTTPS), Port 22 = SSH (remote login).</li>
                        <li><strong>Packets:</strong> Data is broken into small chunks called packets (like breaking a long letter into pages). Each packet has a "from" address, "to" address, and the actual data inside.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Real Example:</strong> When you visit <code>google.com</code>:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Your computer asks a DNS server "What's the IP address for google.com?" (like looking up a phone number)</li>
                        <li>DNS replies: "It's 142.250.80.46"</li>
                        <li>Your computer sends a packet to 142.250.80.46 on Port 443 saying "Hey, send me your homepage!"</li>
                        <li>Google's server sends back packets with the HTML, CSS, images</li>
                        <li>Your browser assembles the packets and displays the page</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Hackers intercept packets (sniffing), pretend to be other computers (spoofing), or flood servers with fake packets (DDoS attacks). Knowing how networking works is ESSENTIAL.</p>

                    <h3>📝 What is "Code" / Programming?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Code is like a recipe. You write step-by-step instructions, and the computer follows them EXACTLY (even if your instructions are wrong!).</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>Variables:</strong> Named storage boxes. <code>age = 25</code> means "create a box called 'age' and put 25 inside."</li>
                        <li><strong>If Statements:</strong> Decisions. "If it's raining, bring umbrella. Otherwise, don't." Computers make millions of these tiny decisions.</li>
                        <li><strong>Loops:</strong> Repetition. "Do this 100 times" or "Keep doing this until X happens."</li>
                        <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Reusable recipes. Instead of writing "make a sandwich" steps every time, define it once and call "makeSandwich()" whenever you need it.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Simple Example in Python:</strong></p>
                    <pre><code>age = 16
if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote!")
else:
    print("Too young to vote.")</code></pre>
                    <p>This checks if age is 18 or more. If yes, print one message. If no, print another.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why Hackers Need Code:</strong> Automation! Instead of manually checking 1000 servers, write a script to do it in seconds. Parsing logs, crafting exploits, building tools — all require coding.</p>

                    <h3>💻 The Command Line / Terminal — The Power User Interface</h3>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> The command line is like texting directly with the computer. Instead of clicking icons (pointing at things), you TYPE exactly what you want.</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>Why Use It?:</strong> Faster, more powerful, scriptable. Many hacking tools ONLY have command-line interfaces.</li>
                        <li><strong>Basic Commands (Linux/Mac):</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>pwd</code> = Print Working Directory (where am I?)</li>
                                <li><code>ls</code> = List files in current folder</li>
                                <li><code>cd &lt;folder&gt;</code> = Change Directory (move into a folder)</li>
                                <li><code>cat &lt;file&gt;</code> = Show file contents</li>
                                <li><code>mkdir &lt;name&gt;</code> = Make a new directory</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Real Example:</strong> You want to see what's in your Documents folder:</p>
                    <pre><code>cd ~/Documents    # Move into Documents folder
ls                # List all files there
cat report.txt    # Read report.txt</code></pre>

                    <p><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Ethical hackers spend 80% of their time in terminals. You'll use command-line tools like <code>nmap</code>, <code>metasploit</code>, <code>burpsuite</code>, etc. Get comfortable NOW.</p>

                        <h4>✅ Chapter 1 Checklist — Can You:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Explain what a CPU, RAM, and storage do in simple terms?</li>
                            <li>Navigate folders using both GUI (clicking) and terminal (typing)?</li>
                            <li>Understand what file permissions mean?</li>
                            <li>Describe how two computers talk over a network?</li>
                            <li>Write a simple 5-line Python script with an if-statement?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> Install a Linux virtual machine (we'll show you how in Chapter 2) and practice basic terminal commands for 15 minutes daily.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <!-- CHAPTER 02: FUNDAMENTALS II -->
                <div class="roadmap-section">
                    <div class="roadmap-number">02</div>
                    <h2>Fundamentals II — Going Deeper Under the Hood</h2>
                    
                    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Chapter 1 taught you WHAT things are. Chapter 2 teaches you HOW they work internally. This bridges the gap between "user" and "power user."</p>

                    <h3>🔧 Operating System Internals — What Happens When You Click?</h3>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> The OS is like a master juggler managing thousands of balls (programs) at once. Let's see HOW it does this magic.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Processes vs Threads</h4>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>Process:</strong> A running program with its own memory space. Like a restaurant (isolated, has its own kitchen/dining area).</li>
                        <li><strong>Thread:</strong> A smaller unit within a process. Like waiters in the restaurant — they all share the same kitchen but work independently.</li>
                        <li><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> A web browser is ONE process with MANY threads (one per tab). If one tab crashes, others survive. Hackers exploit thread synchronization bugs!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Memory Management — Where Does Data Live?</h4>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Imagine memory as a hotel with rooms numbered 0x00000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF (hexadecimal addresses).</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>Stack:</strong> Fast, automatic memory for function calls and local variables. Like sticky notes — quick to write, quick to discard. Limited size (usually 1-8MB).</li>
                        <li><strong>Heap:</strong> Manually managed memory for dynamic data. Like storage units you rent — you must explicitly free them when done or cause a "memory leak."</li>
                        <li><strong>Buffer Overflow Attack:</strong> If a program writes MORE data than a buffer can hold, it spills into adjacent memory — potentially overwriting critical data or injecting malicious code!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Real Example of Buffer Overflow:</strong></p>
                    <pre><code>char password[8];  // 8-byte buffer
gets(password);    // Reads user input (UNSAFE!)
// User types "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" (20 A's)
// Bytes 1-8 fill password buffer
// Bytes 9-20 OVERFLOW into adjacent memory!
// Could overwrite return address → attacker gains control!</code></pre>

                    <h4>System Calls — Asking the OS for Help</h4>
                    <p>Programs can't directly access hardware (security risk!). They must ASK the OS through system calls.</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><code>open()</code> — "OS, please open this file for me"</li>
                        <li><code>read()</code> — "Give me data from this file"</li>
                        <li><code>write()</code> — "Let me write data here"</li>
                        <li><code>execve()</code> — "Launch this program"</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Security Implication:</strong> Hackers exploit bugs in how programs make system calls — passing malicious parameters to trick the OS.</p>

                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Sending a package through multiple checkpoints, each adding a label/wrapper.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Layer 7 (Application):</strong> The actual message — HTTP, DNS, email. "Hey Google, send me your homepage!"</li>
                        <li><strong>Layer 4 (Transport):</strong> TCP/UDP — breaks message into packets, adds port numbers. "This goes to port 443."</li>
                        <li><strong>Layer 3 (Network):</strong> IP addresses. "From 192.168.1.5 to 8.8.8.8."</li>
                        <li><strong>Layer 2 (Data Link):</strong> MAC addresses (physical hardware addresses). "From my network card to the router."</li>
                        <li><strong>Layer 1 (Physical):</strong> Actual electrical signals/light pulses on wires/fiber.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Why Hackers Care:</strong> Each layer can be attacked! Layer 2 (ARP spoofing), Layer 3 (IP spoofing), Layer 7 (SQL injection). Knowing the layers helps you understand WHERE an attack happens.</p>

                    <h4>DNS — The Internet's Phone Book</h4>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> DNS translates human-friendly names (google.com) into computer-friendly numbers (142.250.80.46).</p>
                    <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You type "facebook.com" in browser</li>
                        <li>Browser asks local DNS resolver: "What's the IP for facebook.com?"</li>
                        <li>If cached → instant answer. If not → resolver asks root DNS servers → .com servers → facebook.com's authoritative servers</li>
                        <li>Answer returned: "157.240.241.35"</li>
                        <li>Browser connects to that IP</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>DNS Attacks:</strong> DNS spoofing (fake DNS responses), DNS tunneling (hiding data in DNS queries), typosquatting (gooogle.com → malicious site).</p>

                    <h4>NAT — Why 192.168.x.x is EVERYWHERE</h4>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Only ~4 billion IPv4 addresses exist. Billions of devices need internet!</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Network Address Translation (NAT). Your home router has ONE public IP (visible to internet) but gives PRIVATE IPs (192.168.x.x) to all devices inside.</p>
                    <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li>Your laptop (192.168.1.10) sends packet to google.com</li>
                        <li>Router replaces source IP with its public IP (203.0.113.5)</li>
                        <li>Google replies to 203.0.113.5</li>
                        <li>Router sees reply, translates back to 192.168.1.10, forwards to your laptop</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Security Implication:</strong> NAT acts as a firewall — external attackers can't directly reach your 192.168.x.x devices. BUT port forwarding/UPnP can expose them!</p>

                    <h3>💻 Scripting Mastery — Automation is Power</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Why Scripting is Essential for Hackers</h4>
                    <p>Manual work = slow. Scripts = fast, repeatable, scalable.</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>Recon Automation:</strong> Scan 1000 IPs for open ports in minutes</li>
                        <li><strong>Log Parsing:</strong> Find suspicious patterns in gigabytes of logs</li>
                        <li><strong>Exploit Development:</strong> Test payloads with slight variations automatically</li>
                        <li><strong>Report Generation:</strong> Turn raw data into clean PDF reports</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Bash/Shell Scripting — The Linux Power Tool</h4>
                    <p><strong>Example Script:</strong> Find all files modified in last 24 hours</p>
                    <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
# Save as: find_recent.sh

DIRECTORY="/var/log"
TIME="24h"

echo "Files modified in last $TIME in $DIRECTORY:"
find "$DIRECTORY" -type f -mtime -1 -ls
                    </code></pre>

                    <p><strong>Python Scripting — The Swiss Army Knife</strong></p>
                    <pre><code>import requests
import sys

# Simple port scanner
def scan_port(ip, port):
    try:
        sock = socket.socket()
        sock.settimeout(0.5)
        result = sock.connect_ex((ip, port))
        sock.close()
        return result == 0  # True if open
    except:
        return False

target = sys.argv[1]
for port in [21, 22, 80, 443, 3306, 8080]:
    if scan_port(target, port):
        print(f"Port {port} is OPEN")
    else:
        print(f"Port {port} is closed")</code></pre>

                    <h3>🐙 Version Control with Git — Track EVERYTHING</h3>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Git is like a time machine for your code. Every change is saved, you can go back to any point.</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>Repository (Repo):</strong> A project folder tracked by Git</li>
                        <li><strong>Commit:</strong> A snapshot of your files at a specific time. Like saving your game.</li>
                        <li><strong>Branch:</strong> A parallel timeline. Experiment without affecting the main code.</li>
                        <li><strong>Remote:</strong> Online copy (GitHub/GitLab) — backup + collaboration</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Basic Git Workflow:</strong></p>
                    <pre><code>git init               # Start tracking this folder
git add script.py      # Stage file for commit
git commit -m "Added port scanner"  # Save snapshot
git push origin main   # Upload to GitHub</code></pre>

                    <p><strong>Why Hackers Use Git:</strong> Version control for exploit code, collaborate on tools, maintain public PoCs (Proof of Concepts), track vulnerability research.</p>

                    <h3>🐛 Debugging & Troubleshooting — Finding the "Why"</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Using strace — See What a Program is Doing</h4>
                    <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Shows EVERY system call a program makes.</p>
                    <pre><code>strace ls
# Output shows:
# open("/etc/passwd", O_RDONLY) = 3
# read(3, "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\n...", 4096) = 2314
# ...</code></pre>
                    <p>You see EXACTLY which files it opens, what it reads, what system calls it makes. Invaluable for understanding malware!</p>

                    <h4>GDB — The Debugger</h4>
                    <p>Step through programs line-by-line, inspect memory, set breakpoints.</p>
                    <pre><code>gdb ./program
(gdb) break main     # Pause at main function
(gdb) run            # Start program
(gdb) print var      # Show variable value
(gdb) continue       # Keep going</code></pre>

                    <h3>🐳 Docker Basics — Reproducible Environments</h3>
                    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> "It works on my machine!" — software behaves differently on different systems.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Docker containers package software + dependencies into a portable unit.</p>
                    <p><strong>Metaphor:</strong> Containers are like shipping containers — standardized boxes that work anywhere.</p>
                    <ul class="roadmap-list">
                        <li><strong>Image:</strong> A blueprint/recipe (like a class in programming)</li>
                        <li><strong>Container:</strong> A running instance (like an object)</li>
                        <li><strong>Dockerfile:</strong> Instructions to build an image</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Example Dockerfile:</strong></p>
                    <pre><code>FROM ubuntu:22.04
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 nmap
COPY scan.py /app/
CMD ["python3", "/app/scan.py"]</code></pre>

                    <p><strong>Why Use Docker for Hacking?</strong> Isolate malware analysis, quickly spin up vulnerable test environments, share reproducible exploit setups.</p>
